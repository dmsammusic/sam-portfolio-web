				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">My Journey to Building a Personal Website</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					As an engineer and a lifelong learner, I’ve always enjoyed solving problems and creating solutions. Recently,
					I decided to build my personal website to share journals and thoughts about changes in life and technology.
					Here’s how it all came together in two days during my free time.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Setting the Foundation</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					First, I bought a domain from
					<a
						href="https://www.godaddy.com/"
						class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
						>GoDaddy</a
					>. That was simple, but I knew there was more work ahead. To make my site secure with HTTPS, I used
					<a
						href="https://www.cloudflare.com/"
						class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
						>Cloudflare</a
					>
					for SSL and DNS setup. After some quick configuration, my domain was ready, and I could start building the
					website.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Designing the Website</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					I wanted a space to post journals and blogs, so I decided to use AI-powered tools to speed up the process.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Choosing the Tools</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					To start with the design, I used
					<a
						href="https://www.magicpatterns.com/"
						class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
						>MagicPatterns</a
					>, which gave me a basic design using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and a <strong>React</strong> page. It
					provided a good foundation, but I wanted the design to feel more personal.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Customizing the Design</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					With my basic UI skills and help from
					<a
						href="https://chatgpt.com/"
						class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
						>ChatGPT</a
					>, I adjusted the design to match my style. This combination helped me finish the page design quickly.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Hosting the Website</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					Once the design was ready, I needed a web server to host the site. At first, I thought about using
					<strong>AWS S3</strong> for hosting a static site. But after about an hour of research, I found
					<a
						href="https://github.com/"
						class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
						>GitHub Pages</a
					>. It seemed perfect for my needs because it automatically updates the site whenever I push code changes.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Setting Up the Hosting</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					I uploaded a simple index page to GitHub Pages. The setup was easy, and I loved how it updated automatically
					whenever I pushed changes to the repository.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4">Adding the Blog Feature</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					With the hosting set up, I decided to add a blog page. Once again, I worked with ChatGPT to fine-tune the
					design and functionality. After testing the site on mobile devices, I realized it needed some adjustments.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Refining Mobile Views</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					To make sure the site worked well on mobile devices, I manually adjusted the design. The
					<a
						href="https://tailwindcss.com/"
						class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"
						>Tailwind CSS</a
					>
					documentation helped me learn and apply responsive design techniques. This hands-on experience improved my
					skills and gave me better control over the final result.
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Reflections on the Journey</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					The whole process—from buying the domain to creating the blog—took just two days during my free time. Along
					the way, I learned a few key lessons:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
					<li>
						<strong>Focus on Solving Problems:</strong> As an engineer, I’ve learned to focus on solving problems rather
						than just chasing new technology.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Programming is a Tool:</strong> It’s about communicating with machines to make them work for us. AI
						tools like ChatGPT became a helpful part of my toolkit.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>AI is a Helper:</strong> Like calculators, AI helps us focus on higher-level problems, enabling
						innovation and creativity.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Final Thoughts</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
					Building this website wasn’t just a technical project—it reflected my approach to engineering and
					problem-solving. Humans are great at making decisions and using tools to achieve their goals. In this modern
					AI era, we have the chance to use these tools to innovate and create better things.
				</p>
				<p class="text-gray-700">
					I’m excited to keep learning and sharing my experiences. Here’s to solving problems, thinking big, and making
					the most of the tools we have!
				</p>
